# Contributing

If you want to request a feature or an improvement. Feel free to post an [issue](https://github.com/NightfallAlicorn/urban-dictionary/issues) about it. This is preferable than a post request, in case I decline it for whatever reason without wasting your time.

Please note that the code has to be in [standardjs](https://standardjs.com) coding style.

I prefer that this module does not use outside dependencies except Node.js built-in ones.
