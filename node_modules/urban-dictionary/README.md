## Actions

### defid
If you know the `defid` of the term. You can use this to just retrieve the Definition Object of that entry only.

*Arguments*

* `id` **{Number}** The `defid` to retrieve.
* `callback` **{Function}**
    * `error` **{Error}** if there's an error else **{null}**
    * `entry` **{[Definition Object](#definition-object)}**
    * `tags` **{Array of String}** Tags of related words.
    * `sounds` **{Array of String}** Full link addresses to `.mp3` and `.wav` files.

E.g

```javascript
const ud = require('urban-dictionary')

var id = 2488552

ud.defid(id, function (error, entry, tags, sounds) {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error.message)
  } else {
    console.log(entry.word)
    console.log(entry.definition)
    console.log(entry.example)
  }
})
```

### random
Use this to obtain a random definition.

Due to the way that Urban Dictionary's API works. It will in fact retrieve 10 definitions at once. This action will store all 10 in a cache on first use and provide them 1 at a time on each use. Each entry that gets provided gets removed from the cache. Once all the entries have been provided, it will retrieve another 10 once the cache is empty. Until all the entries have been provided, all the definitions that are currently stored in the cache are provided first.

*Arguments*

* `callback` **{Function}**
    * `error` **{Error}** if there's an error else **{null}**
    * `entry` **{[Definition Object](#definition-object)}**

E.g

```javascript
const ud = require('urban-dictionary')

ud.random(function (error, entry) {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error.message)
  } else {
    console.log(entry.word)
    console.log(entry.definition)
    console.log(entry.example)
  }
})
```

### term
Use this to manually retrieve an already existing definition.

*Arguments*

* `definition` **{String}** The definition to search for.
* `callback` **{Function}**
    * `error` **{Error}** if there's an error else **{null}**
    * `entries` **{Array of [Definition Object](#definition-object)}**
    * `tags` **{Array of String}** Tags of related words.
    * `sounds` **{Array of String}** Full link addresses to `.mp3` and `.wav` files.

E.g

```javascript
const ud = require('urban-dictionary')

var definition = "word"

ud.term(definition, function (error, entries, tags, sounds) {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error.message)
  } else {
    console.log(entries[0].word)
    console.log(entries[0].definition)
    console.log(entries[0].example)
  }
})
```

## FAQ

* Q: Where did you get the URL to access Urban Dictionary's API? They hadn't got a documented page.
    * A: I just found them floating around on the web years ago. I don't have a source, sorry.
* Q: Are there any more methods?
    * A: Sorry. But these are the only URLs I'm aware of:
        * `http://api.urbandictionary.com/v0/define` with `?term=WORD_HERE` or `?defid=DEFID_HERE`
        * `http://api.urbandictionary.com/v0/random`
* Q: If they haven't documented it. Are we even allowed to use their site API?
    * A: I don't really know the answer. However, sites nowadays use an authorization name and password in the URL queries to restrict their API access to certain individuals. If Urban Dictionary didn't want others using it, they would had done so by now. In short: As long as we don't abuse the API to spam requests, we should be fine.
* Q: Why use standardjs coding style?
    * A: There are many different coding rules of JavaScript being used today. Since this standard is being used by many packages and is becoming common on github. I've decided to start using it myself and quickly started to like it. It saves time by not having to worry which rules to follow or finding ways around strict styles such as JSLint.
